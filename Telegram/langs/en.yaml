locks_help: |
     Do stickers annoy you? or want to avoid people sharing links? or pictures?
     You're in the right place!
     The locks module allows you to lock away some common items in the
     telegram world; the bot will automatically delete them!

     *Admins only:*
      • `/lock <type>`*:* Lock items of a certain type (not available in private)
      • `/unlock <type>`*:* Unlock items of a certain type (not available in private)
      • `/locks`*:* The current list of locks in this chat.

     Locking urls will auto-delete all messages with urls, locking stickers will restrict all
     non-admin users from sending stickers, etc.
     Locking bots will stop non-admins from adding bots to the chat.

     *Note:*

markdown_help_text: |
      Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. Kigyo has some enhancements, to make sure that
      saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.

      - <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
      - <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
      - <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
      - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>,
      and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
      EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>

      - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram
      buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code>
      will be the url which is opened.
      EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

      If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
      <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
      [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
      This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

      Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!

sticker_blacklist_help: |
       **Only admin:**
         • `/addblsticker <sticker link>**`:** Add the sticker trigger to the black list. Can be added via reply sticker
         • `/unblsticker <sticker link>**`:** Remove triggers from blacklist. The same newline logic applies here, so you can delete multiple triggers at once
         • `/rmblsticker <sticker link>**`:** Same as above
         • `/blstickermode <delete/ban/tban/mute/tmute>**`:** sets up a default action on what to do if users use blacklisted stickers
       Note:
         • `<sticker link>` can be `https://t.me/addstickers/<sticker>` or just `<sticker>` or reply to the sticker message
